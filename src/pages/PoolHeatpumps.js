      <h1>Pool Heatpumps</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Heat pumps are  the most efficient way to heat your pool water as they utilise the solar heat stored in the surrounding environment, which provides approximately 75% of the heat pumps heating energy and only approximately 25% of external energy is required in the form of electricity in order to achieve a heat output of 100%.</p>

      <h2>Warranty</h2>
      <p>One  year from date of installation or alternatively date of manufacture, if proof of the installation date cannot be proven.</p>

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <p>Heating Capacity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5.6Kw for pools under 20,000L</li>
        <li>12.5 Kw for pools 20,000 to 40,000L</li>
        <li>Larger units available on request</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Heat Pumps</h2>
      <p>A heat pump works like an air conditioning unit in reverse. It extracts heat from the ambient air surrounding it, enabling it to heat the refrigerant which is then compressed causing it to get even hotter. This is then run through a heat exchanger in which the water is heated. The refrigerant is then allowed to expand again, thus cooling it down and enabling it to again absorb heat from the surrounding air. So only a little electricity is used to run a fan and compressor while the heat energy is provided indirectly by the sun.</p>
      <p>TS heat pumps boast a 500% efficiency rating which means you will gain a return on investment in less than 1 year. You and your family will experience hours of fun in the pool instead of around the pool.</p>
      <p>Not only did you pay a lot of money to build your pool but it is also costing you a lot of money per month to maintain. The average pool owner in Namibia only uses his pool for 3 months of the year because the water is simply to cold the rest of the time. By using an ITS heat pump you can now enjoy your pool all year round thus getting the most from your swimming pool investment. You and your family will experience hours of fun in the pool instead of around the pool.</p>
